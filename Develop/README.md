# JavaScript: Password Generator

## Project Description

The password generator was created using the Web API (window.prompt) land JavScript methos like confirm(), Math.floor, and Math.random.

Once the user clicks the 'Generate Password' button, he will immediately see a window prompt that asks the user to enter the desired number of characters for the password. Length of password must be between 8 and 128 characters; otherwise, user will get a message on the screen that says "Invalid password length. Try again".

Questions about the inclusion of lower-case, upper-case, numeric, and special characters in the password will be asked to the user in respective order. After selecting [OK] or [Cancel] buttons according to user's preferences, a randomized password will be generated and displayed on the screen.
